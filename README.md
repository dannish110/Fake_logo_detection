### Fake Logo Detection Project

#### Overview

The Fake Logo Detection project aims to create a system that identifies counterfeit logos in digital images, helping to protect brand integrity and consumer trust.

#### Key Features

- **Image Analysis**: Uses advanced techniques to preprocess and analyze images.
- **Machine Learning**: Trains models to distinguish between genuine and fake logos.
- **Real-time Detection**: Provides instant feedback on logo authenticity.
- **User Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for uploading and checking images.
- **Scalable**: Handles large volumes of images for corporate and marketplace use.

#### Technologies

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training models.
- **Flask**: For the web application.
- **Git**: For version control.

#### Usage

1. **Train**: Use scripts to train the model on logo datasets.
2. **Detect**: Upload images via the web interface for detection.
3. **Evaluate**: Use provided metrics to assess model performance.

This project helps in combating counterfeit products by providing an efficient and accurate fake logo detection system.
